# de novo genome assembly
run-wgs.sge				command used to run CA
wgs_specfile.spec			specfile upon which CA depends
melanogaster-filter.frg			frg file that gives additional parameters and points to fastq used for assembly

# analysis of long-read data
generate-error-counts.sh		commands used to generate the error profiles used as input for error-rates.R, also used to find positions of mismatches to compare to DGRP
error-rates.R				R script to plot position-dependent error profiles of long reads

# analysis of assembly
alignment-stats.sh			commands used to generate alignment results for Table 2
te-glm.R				R script to generate GLM and GLMM to test features of TEs important for assembly
te-data.csv				data from FlyTE database used as predictors in GLM/GLMM

# see assess-assembly repo for script to assess presence/absence of genomic features (i.e. the response variable for the GLMM)
