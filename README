# de novo genome assembly
run_wgs.sge -- command used to run CA
wgs_specfile.spec -- specfile upon which CA depends
melanogaster.frg -- frg file that gives additional parameters and points to fastq used for assembly
run_minimus2.sh -- script used to run minimus2

# analysis of long-read data
extract_deletions.sh -- script that reformats CIGAR string and calls perl script to calculate positions of deletions in alignments.
generate_deletion_profile.pl -- script required by extract_deletions.sh to get deletion positions from CIGAR string.

# analysis of assembly
alignment_stats.sh -- commands used to generate alignment results for Table 2
te_glm.R -- R script to generate GLM and GLMM to test features of TEs important for assembly
te_data.csv -- data from FlyTE database used as predictors in GLM/GLMM

# see assess-assembly repository for script to assess presence/absence of genomic features (i.e. the response variable for the GLMM)
